# General Introduction

## 1. Context and Motivation
In today's fast-paced corporate environment, the efficient management of human resources is critical for organizational success. Traditional, paper-based, or fragmented digital systems often lead to data redundancy, errors, and inefficiencies. The **Human Resources Management System (HRMS)** developed in this project aims to digitize and centralize these operations, providing a robust solution for tracking employees, departments, and organizational structures.

This project is realized as part of the academic curriculum, serving as a practical implementation of **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** principles and **Software Engineering** best practices.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many organizations struggle with:
- Decentralized employee data making retrieval difficult.
- Lack of clear visualization of organizational hierarchy (Departments/Bodies).
- Inefficient conceptualization of retirement planning.
- Poor user interfaces that hinder productivity.

## 3. Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Centralization**: Create a single source of truth for all HR data.
2. **Digitization**: Automate the tracking of employee lifecycles from hiring to retirement.
3. **Usability**: Design an ergonomic, user-friendly interface using **Flutter**.
4. **Reliability**: Ensure data consistency using a proper backend architecture.
5. **Accessibility**: Support multiple roles (PM, Agent, Archiver) and languages (English/Arabic).

## 4. Methodology: RUP (Rational Unified Process)
We adopted the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** for this project. RUP is an iterative software development process framework created by the Rational Software Corporation. It divides the development process into four distinct phases:

1. **Inception Phase**: We analyzed the core requirements, identified the key actors (PM, Agent), and defined the scope of the project.
2. **Elaboration Phase**: We designed the system architecture (MVC), selected the technology stack (Flutter/Dart), and modeled the system using **UML**.
3. **Construction Phase**: We implemented the solution, writing the code for the various modules (Employee Management, Departments, etc.) and integrating with the backend.
4. **Transition Phase**: This involves testing, deployment, and user documentation (current phase).

## 5. Document Structure
This report is organized as follows:
- **Chapter 1: Specifications** details the functional and non-functional requirements and textual use cases.
- **Chapter 2: Modeling** presents the UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Deployment) representing the system design.
- **Chapter 3: Implementation** discusses the technologies used, the application architecture, and security measures.
- **General Conclusion** summarizes the work and outlines future perspectives.
